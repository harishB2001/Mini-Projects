Instructions to make the things work, 
I recomend using Windows Operating System..
step 1: Make Sure Mysql Workbench and XAMPP server is installed
step 2: Create a MySQl user  
step 3: import db_bbms.sql in mysql Workbench
step 4: locate the XAMPP server installation path and copy bbms directory to xampp/htdocs 
step 5: open (with notepad) mysqli.php file  located under bbms directory 
step 6: (continuation of above step)change the value of  $user and $pass with your MySQl username and password
step 7: open XAMPP control panel, Start apache server 
step 8: Open Browser type localhost/bbms_codes 

    And you see that Works :)
