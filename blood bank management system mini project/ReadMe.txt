Instructions to make the things work, 
I recomend using Windows Operating System..
step 1: Make Sure Mysql Workbench and XAMPP server is installed
step 2: Create a MySQl user 
step 3: Extract the Downloaded package 
step 4: import db_bbms.sql in mysql Workbench
step 5: locate the XAMPP server installation path and copy bbms directory to xampp/htdocs 
step 6: open (with notepad) mysqli.php file  located under bbms directory 
step 7: (continuation of above step)change the value of  $user and $pass with your MySQl username and password
step 8: open XAMPP control panel, Start apache server 
step 9: Open Browser type localhost/bbms_codes
